## Overview
### 1. Intended plan of study
The application of educational technology has been proved essential to the optimization of teaching and learning experience in this internet era. However, due to a variety of reasons, few teachers and students have enough time or experience in choosing the right technology and cultivating its full potential in practice. To address this issue, the current project aims to help teachers (and all level of educators in general) to leverage online teaching applications and solutions by establishing a well organized, searchable web database. It features practical guides on most widely used teaching and learning technologies, as well as routinely updated blog entries with introductions, comments, comparisons, and critics on the most state-of-the-art these technologies.
### 2. Work to be produced 
This online database project is planned to realize five core functions:
#### 1. A landing page
to elaborate the purpose and aim of the project, along with a personal introduction of the producer.
#### 2. A blog system (with sharing function)
each blog is dedicated to either the introduction to a single pedagogical technology or the analysis and comparison between several similar technological solutions to a specific need in a teaching and learning scenario. The producer expects to add as many original video guidance into these blogs as possible.
#### 3. A multi-dimensional search engine
users can locate the exact tool or solution of what they expect to find according to several properties such as platforms (web, iOS, macOS, etc.), users (teachers, students, principles/administrators, etc.), tasks (homework distribution, school management, pedagogy, class presentation, etc.).
#### 4. A recommendation system 
can generate dynamic links to the blogs or video introductions of tools for them to explore according to the search results or the topics they are reading.
#### A comment and feedback portal
for users to provide feedback, suggestions for every blog entry. It also serves as the channel of request for any further addition of database content.
### 3. Project schedule
#### Phase 1. Design of website user interface and the database model
Mid-May to early June, 2018.
#### Phase 2. Front-end programming: building the layout of all web pages of the website.
Early-June to mid-June, 2018.
#### Phase 3. Back-end programming: building the database and test its interactability with the front-end design.
Mid-June to late July, 2018 (because the producer has a summer course in the firs two weeks of July)
#### Phase 4. Content addition: launch of the website to world wide web (WWW) while keeping writing, compiling and editing the blogs entries at the same time.
### 4. Other notes
The project is a non-funded project, and the first version of it is open to everyone to browse and comment on. The producer promises to update the database during and after the project period on a regular basis, and expects to add more functions in the future once it gains more publicity.
